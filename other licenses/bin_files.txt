The authors of cc3dsfs do not claim ownership of any
of the files included in the bin folder of the application's source code.

The ftd2_ds2_* files were created by Loopy (who directly sent them
so they could be used in cc3dsfs).

The is_twl_cap* files were created to improve performance when using compatible
hardware. It is also possible to recreate the tables they contain at runtime
by using specific magic numbers. However, their contents seem to be fixed.
So they are included as bin files instead.

The nisetro_ds* file was obtained from the source available software
NiseTro Preview (build 20100316), then edited for improved interoperability
and support for multiple concurrent connections.

The optimize* files were extracted from wireshark packets, then edited
for usage with a more generic driver, improved interoperability, and
support for multiple concurrent connections.
