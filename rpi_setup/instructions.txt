Use the official Raspberry Pi OS tool to install "Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)" (or 32 bit if that is not available) (Debian Bookworm, at the time of writing)
for your version of the Pi on an SD card. User name and password are not important.
If you want to save space, use the Lite version of the OS. The setup is compatible with those versions as well.

Turn on the Pi with the SD card and complete the first setup (if any).

Place the cc3dsfs_rpi_kiosk_setup.zip file in the Pi (either by downloading it, by using an USB stick or by placing it inside the bootfs partition).

You will need an active internet connection to complete the setup.
Decompress all the files of the .zip into a folder.
Right Click on setup.sh > Properties > Permissions > Change Execute from "Nobody" to "Owner only".
Double Click on setup.sh and select "Execute in Terminal". Then wait for the script to finish. It will reboot on its own.

(Audio may not work after the first reboot. If that happens, remove the power and try turning the Raspberry Pi on again)

By default, the setup will work with a specific GPIO buttons layout. But scripts to account for other button layouts are also included. To change the default, replace the file Desktop/cc3dsfs_script.sh with one of the others included in Desktop/premade_scripts (or make your own).

To launch back the Desktop environment (can be useful to update the software), you can use the "Quit Application" "Extra Setting" (or press Esc on a keyboard). This should show a terminal. Then, type:
startx

By default the setup will try to expand the filesystem during the first reboot after the setup. To avoid that, create a file at "/expanded_rootfs". If you wish for the filesystem expansion to run again, simply delete the "/expanded_rootfs" file and reboot.
